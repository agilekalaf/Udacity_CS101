#Write Python code that stores the distance 
#in meters that light travels in one 
#nanosecond in the variable, nanodistance. 

#These variables are defined for you:
speed_of_light = 299800000. #meters per second
nano_per_sec = 1000000000. #1 Billion

#After your code,running
#print nanodistance
#should output 0.2998

#Note that nanodistance must be a decimal number.

#DO NOT USE IMPORT

nanodistance = speed_of_light/nano_per_sec





#ASSIGN nanodistance HERE

print nanodistance
